## Trigger TFF
The T flip-flop is a single input version of the JK flip-flop. As shown in figure, the T flip-flop is obtained from the JK type if both inputs are tied together. The output of the T flip-flop “toggles” with each clock pulse.

## 
The entity will declare the input and output ports for the T flip-flop. We have the clock, the reset, and the T input as actual inputs. The outputs are just the usual Q and Qb. As has been the case with all the remaining flip-flops, we will use behavioral architecture. That’s the entity-architecture pair sorted right there.
